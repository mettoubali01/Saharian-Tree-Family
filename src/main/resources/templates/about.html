                        <article>Western Sahara (Arabic: الصحراء الغربية‎‎ aṣ-Ṣaḥrā' al-Gharbiyyah; Berber languages: Taneẓroft Tutrimt; Spanish: Sáhara Occidental)
                            is a disputed territory on the northwest coast and in the Maghreb region of North and West Africa. About 20% of the territory is controlled by
                            the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, while the remaining 80% of the territory is occupied and administered by neighboring
                            Morocco. Its surface area amounts to 266,000 square kilometres (103,000 sq mi). It is one of the most sparsely populated territories in
                            the world, mainly consisting of desert flatlands. The population is estimated at just over 500,000,[3] of which nearly 40% live in
                            Laayoune, the largest city in Western Sahara.

                            Occupied by Spain until 1975, Western Sahara has been on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since 1963 after a Moroccan
                            demand.[4] It is the most populous territory on that list, and by far the largest in area. In 1965, the United Nations General Assembly
                            adopted its first resolution on Western Sahara, asking Spain to decolonize the territory.[5] One year later, a new resolution was passed
                            by the General Assembly requesting that a referendum be held by Spain on self-determination.[6] In 1975, Spain relinquished the administrative
                            control of the territory to a joint administration by Morocco (which had formally claimed the territory since 1957)[7] and Mauritania.
                            [6] A war erupted between those countries and a Sahrawi nationalist movement, the Polisario Front, which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab
                            Democratic Republic (SADR) with a government in exile in Tindouf, Algeria. Mauritania withdrew its claims in 1979, and Morocco eventually
                            secured de facto control of most of the territory, including all the major cities and natural resources. The United Nations considers the
                            Polisario Front to be the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, and maintains that the Sahrawis have a right to self-determination.
